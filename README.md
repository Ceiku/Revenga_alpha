# Revenga_alpha
A project between some friends at our first year of college, need further work.
Only a handful of the funtionality is implemented at this point, and with few contributors the project updates rarely.


# Introduction

A binary visualization tool for reversed engineering without any prerequisite knowledge of files or system.
Heavily inspired by earlier work og Greg Conti and Aldo Cortesi. Trying to find patterns in arbitrary sets of binary data.

It is a JavaFX GUI with basic 2D model representations. Hilbert curves are the go-to mapping for our 1D binary arrays onto 2D surfaces. 
3D and dynamic representations of data may be updated at a later point.
